DMD D2 test suite
=================

This repository contains a mirror of the D2 test suite as found in
the test/ directory of the official DMD repository [1].

It is intended for use as Git submodule in the development of LDC or
other alternative compilers.

The 'master' branch and all tags contain a pristine copy of the files
in the DMD repository, the 'ldc' branch also has some LDC-specific
adjustments and fixes.


Updating the repository
-----------------------

Updates from upstream are folded in using the update-dmd-testsuite
script found in the ldc-scripts repository [2]. It performs a new
history rewrite on the DMD repository each time, so please leave
the master branch (or any tags, ...) alone, as this would change the
SHA-1 commit ids and thus break the process.
